    "# Naive Bayes Classifiers\n",
    "[Naive Bayes Classifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) are a thoroughly studied and popular option for classification because of their ease of training, scalability (linear in the number of features) in training and prediction, and intuitive probabilistic understanding.  Despite their rather stringent (\"naive\") restrictions in the **assumption that the features are conditionally independent**, they are still often able to perform reasonably well in the right situations.  Particularly, Naive Bayes Classifiers have historically been frequently used as (baseline) methods for classification of raw text documents, so those are the type of tasks that we will investigate with them today.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "- Understand how the [Multinomial Naive Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier#Multinomial_naive_Bayes) model is used for [**text classification**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_classification)\n",
    "- Introduction to the [Bag of Words Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) for text analysis\n",
    "- Create features out of raw text data with `sklearn`\n",
    "- Evaluate various classification performance metrics with `sklearn`\n",

    "## Datasets\n",
    "- [Amazon Review Sentiment](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences): single sentences from raw-text Amazon reviews where each review has been labeled as having positive, negative, or neutral sentiment\n",

    "### Extracting Features from Text Data\n",
    "The only feature we currently have for each observation is the raw text of the review.  We need to find a way to transform this into a ***useful vector of numeric features*** for every review.  To do this we'll use what's called a [Bag of Words Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bag of Words Model\n",
    "An important discovery in text analysis was the realization that a shocking amount of value could be gleaned simply from the words (or ***tokens***) that appear in a text document (irrespective of other considerations like word order, grammar, etc).  This hypothesis is generally referred to the ***Bag of Words*** hypothesis, that just the set of words that make up a document dictate most of the conceptual content of the document.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests some ways that we can turn our raw text into numeric features.  The basic idea is that for a set of text documents to analyze (a ***corpus*** of documents) we could build up a ***dictionary*** of all the words/tokens that ever appear in any of the documents.  Each token in this dictionary then becomes a new feature in our feature space, and thus the number of features for each document will be the total number of tokens in that dictionary.  Now that we have defined a feature space, we can come up with a number of increasingly complex (yet still simple) schemes to provide values for those features...\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Boolean Word Occurrence Model\n",
    "The first, and simplest feature model is one of binary word occurrence.  Simply put, for a given document and for every word in the features dictionary, the feature value for the respective word is set to 1 if the document contains the word and 0 otherwise.  In `sklearn` we can do this simply with the `CountVectorizer` class with the appropriate parameters as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Word Frequency Model\n",
    "Slightly more complex than the binary model is a frequency model.  Instead of getting a 1, the document will get the count of occurrences of the word in that document for every word in the document (and 0 otherwise).  Obviously this is encoding more information and thus should be better as long as we can fit it into our framework for classification (and we can).  We will see how easily we can do this below with the `CountVectorizer` class of `sklearn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Weighted Frequency Schemes - TFIDF\n",
    "A step further than the basic frequency model involves adding weights to our frequency feature model that allow us to better capture the way words are distributed in text.  A common example is [TFIDF Weighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) which basically is any technique that gives an **upscore** to words occurring many times **within the document (Term Frequency TF)** and a **downscore** to words occurring many times **throughout all documents (Inverse Document Frequency IDF)**.  For instance, glue words like \"the\" and \"and\" have almost zero conceptual value to add and occur many times in all documents, so they will be weighted less.  `sklearn` allows us to easily perform TFIDF weighting with the `TfidfVectorizer` as we will also see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Creation with sklearn\n",
    "Before we try out the 3 schemes above, let's quickly understand how [`CountVectorizer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) works.  It uses a training set to train a Vectorizer object that will then be able to take any future raw text and convert it into an appropriate feature vector.  Here's a very simple example:"

    "#### ROC Curve\n",
    "As we've seen, we can generally increase our recall for a given class at the expense of precision and vice versa.  [ROC Curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) attempt to capture this relationship by ploting the **True Positive Rate** against the **False Positive Rate** across the spectrum of thresholds for predicting a positive class.  The extreme cases are predicting all classes to be positive (large false positive rate) or predicting none or very few to be positive (large true positive rate).  An ideal ROC curve would be a perfect right angle that maintains a 100% True Positive Rate even at 0 False Positive Rate, thus the closer a curve is to this ideal the better our model.  We can measure how close our ROC Curve is to ideal by measuring the area under the curve.\n",
