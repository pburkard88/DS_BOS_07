    "\n",
    "Some implementations of classification trees will allow you to handle categorical predictors **without creating dummy variables**. When splitting on a categorical predictor, they will try splitting on **every possible combination of categories** to find the best split. In the example above, \"ChestPain:bc\" means that the left-hand branch consists of observations with the second and third ChestPain categories, and the right-hand branch consists of remaining observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unfortunately, scikit-learn's classification tree implementation does not support this approach.** Instead, here's how you can handle categorical predictors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a predictor only has **two possible values**, code it as a single binary variable (0 or 1). Since it's treated as a number, splits will naturally occur at 0.5.\n",
    "- If a predictor has **three or more possible values that are ordered**, code it as a single variable (1, 2, 3, etc). Splits will naturally occur at 1.5, 2.5, etc.\n",
    "- If a predictor has **three or more possible values that are unordered**, create dummy variables and drop one level as usual. The decision tree won't know that the dummy variables are related to one another, but that shouldn't matter in terms of predictive accuracy.\n",
    "- If a predictor has **thousands of possible unordered values**, then it may be best to code it as a single variable (1, 2, 3, etc) instead of using dummy variables to minimize the size of the resulting model. ([reference](http://stackoverflow.com/a/18736132/1636598))\n",
