    "Some implementations of classification trees will allow you to handle categorical predictors **without creating dummy variables**. When splitting on a categorical predictor, they will try splitting on **every possible combination of categories** to find the best split. In the example above, \"ChestPain:bc\" means that the left-hand branch consists of observations with the second and third ChestPain categories, and the right-hand branch consists of remaining observations.\n",

    "- If a predictor only has **two possible values**, code it as a single binary variable (0 or 1). Since it's treated as a number, splits will naturally occur at 0.5.\n",
    "- If a predictor has **three or more possible values that are ordered**, code it as a single variable (1, 2, 3, etc). Splits will naturally occur at 1.5, 2.5, etc.\n",
    "- If a predictor has **three or more possible values that are unordered**, create dummy variables and drop one level as usual. The decision tree won't know that the dummy variables are related to one another, but that shouldn't matter in terms of predictive accuracy.\n",

    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision trees are prone to errors in classification problems with many class and relatively small number of training examples.\n",
    "- Recursive binary splitting makes \"locally optimal\" decisions that may not result in a globally optimal tree\n",
    "- Can create biased trees if the classes are highly imbalanced\n",
